I was born in Somerset, NJ and first lived in Bound Brook. 
When I was 1 we moved to Dunellen. I lived there until the age of 9, when we moved to Florida
Florida was short lived: my parents seperated and my mother and I moved in with mt grandmother in Springfield, New Jersey
It was around that age I discovered I could move object with my mind fir the first time.
If I was angry, I could even set them on fire. Unfortunately I discovered that when my cousin, Alan, pissed me off. 
He pushed me while we were playing and never knew hit him. I can still remember the screams and that awful smell
I had to hide the body. Fortunately the park we were playing at had some woods.
Afterwards, I worked on controlling my powers. I started moving my teacher's chairs out from under them when they went to sit down at their desks. That was always good for a laugh.
As I developed more finesse, I found I could tie the school bullies' shoe laces together.
When I was 11 my mother moved me again, this time, in with her boyfriend, to South Plainfield, NJ.
I hated it there. The kids were mean to me. I was not having it. It was time to put my skills to use...  
Dominic Supa was a punk. He teased me. In math class he sat behind me and jabbed me in the arm with a pencil whenever the teacher wasn't looking.
